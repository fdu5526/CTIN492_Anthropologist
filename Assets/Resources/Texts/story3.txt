Dearest Astoria, it's been a month since Professor Willem left. He was right; the harvests are bad. The town folks are talking and the richer ones already started moving out. The ones that are staying are either poor, or skeptical of the curse.

But unlike them, I now know that the curse is real. Professor Willem gave me the keys to his private archives, hidden in the east corner of Byrgenwerth, and I have been staying up late every night there researching. Apparently the cause is of a demon, taking the form of a fog that was carried here by the northern winter storms, which slowly eats away the life of the land.

Now of course that sounds terrifying, but I do believe that I am onto a way to stop it. By the time you come back, all will be well, and Professor Willem will eat his words. Sometimes problems can be fixed with a little knowledge and courage rather than just fleeing.
