Dearest Astoria, it's been a month since Peter left. He was right; the harvests are bad. 

The towns folks are talking, and the luckier ones already started moving out. The ones that are staying are either poor, or skeptical of the curse. But unlike them, I do know that the curse is real. Peter gave me the keys to his library, and I have been staying up late researching. 

Apparently the cause is of a demon, taking the form of a fog that is blown here by the northern winter storms, eating away the life force of the land. Now of course that sounds scary, but I do believe that I am onto a way to stop it.
