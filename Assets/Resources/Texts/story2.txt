Dearest Astoria, Professor Willem ran to the town center today. He showed everyone his diagrams and rambled about calculations. He revealed how he observed the flow of the lands and the blows of the wind. He said that this land is cursed, and it's best if we all pack up and leave before it's too late.

But everyone was just confused; this has been our home for generations, so they ignored him. I tried to talk to him afterwards, because I know this is beyond his normal craziness, and he told me that it’s a waste of my talent to stay and fight the curse. He said that it’s better to enjoy this summer while it lasts and to tuck tail and run as soon as the first leaves fall.

But with the accumulated knowledge of the Byrgenwerth Academy, what can we not fight against? So I said that I've learned enough to take care of the town, but he just looked away in silence. If you were here, you would agree with me. Won’t you, Astoria?
