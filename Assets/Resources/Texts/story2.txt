Dearest Astoria, old Professor Peter ran to the towncenter today. He showed everyone his diagrams and rambled about calculations. He revealed how he observed the flow of the lands and the blows of the wind. He said that this land is cursed, and it's best if we all pack up and leave before it's too late. 

But everyone was just confused; this has been our home for generations, so they ignored him. 

I tried to talk to him afterwards, because I know he isn't crazy, but he said that it is a waste of my talent to stay and fight the curse. I said that I've learned enough to take care of the town, but he just looked away in silence.
