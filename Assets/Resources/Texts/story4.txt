Dearest Astoria. The first snow fell, two months earlier than normal. The towns folks are starting to become very worried, and so am I. 

My last four attempts at dispelling the demonic fog has failed. I read as much as I could in the library, but I have no breakthrough. The townspeople are constantly knocking on my door, begging me for help, but I am desperate too. Their frantic mood are distracting me from my research and stressing me out. 

I can only find calmness when I am writing to you. But if this snow continues, and it will be if I cannot lift the curse, then my letters will cease to be delivered. But hey, I am an optimist, so wish me luck!
