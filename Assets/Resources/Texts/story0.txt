Dearest Astoria. How have you been? I hope all is well with your journey. As for here, the summer loons have returned to the creek, and these bastards were nibbing at your favorite water lilies again.

Now, I tried to chase them off just like you did in the past, but I guess my coordination will never get close to yours. Maybe I should have tried conjuring a mirage to fend them off, since I've gotten pretty good at that now. 

But don't worry, even though Professor Peter might assert that I tumbled into the creek in his letter, that old fart is full of lies as usual.
