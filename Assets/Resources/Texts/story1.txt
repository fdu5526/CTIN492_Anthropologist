Dearest Astoria. How have you been? I hope all is well with your journey. As for here, the summer loons have returned to the creek, and these bastards were nibbing at your favorite water lilies again.

Now, I tried to chase them off just like you did in the past, but I guess my coordination will never get close to yours. But don't worry, even though Anna might assert that I tumbled into the creek, I can assure you that she is full of lies.
