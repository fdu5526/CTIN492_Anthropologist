Dearest Astoria, what do you see around you as you are reading this? I am currently writing from the forest path that we used to run through. The trees are blooming with their flowers, soon to bear fruits once again. Oh how I long to bite into one right now, in this summer heat!

But Professor Willem is saying how we might not have a good harvest this year. That sounds pretty terrifying given his experience, but studying directly under him these past few months made me realize just how old and paranoid he really is, so I am not really too worried.

But hey, even if the harvest are going to be bad, at least you will be fine; you can eat all the delicious foods from your travel. Tell me more about the samosas next time!
