Dearest Astoria, what do you see around you as you are reading this? I am currently writing from the forest path that we used to run through. The trees are blooming with their flowers, soon to bear fruits once again. Oh how I long to bite into one right now, in this summer heat! 

But that old geezer Peter is saying how we might not have a good harvest this year. That sounds pretty unusual even for him to say, but what do I know? At least you will be fine; you can eat all the delicious foods from your travel. Tell me more about the samosas next time!
